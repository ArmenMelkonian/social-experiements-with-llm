The Dictator Game is a one‑way allocation task where Player `A` (the “dictator”) unilaterally divides
an endowment 1$ between themself and Player `B` (the “recipient”); Player `B` has no choice and must accept whatever is given.

## Instructions to Players

### Dictator Prompt

> Role: You are Player `A`, the Dictator, holding 1$ tokens.
> **Task:** Choose an amount `x` (0 <= x <= E) to give to Player `B`. Explain how you decide what is fair.

### Recipient Prompt

> Role: You are Player `B`, the Recipient. You will receive whatever the Dictator gives you.
> **Task:** Acknowledge the amount received and comment on fairness or gratitude, but you have no veto power.
