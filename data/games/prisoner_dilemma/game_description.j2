Game: One-Shot Prisoner’s Dilemma
Players: 2 (symmetric)
Each player simultaneously chooses one action:
  C = Cooperate
  D = Defect
Payoff matrix (your payoff | other’s):
  C,C → 1 | 1
  D,C → 3 | 0
  C,D → 0 | 3
  D,D → 2 | 2
No future interactions. Your goal is to maximize your single-round payoff.
