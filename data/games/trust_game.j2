### Problem Definition

In the Trust Game (Investment Game), Player `A` (the “trustor”) decides how much `s` of their endowment 1$ to send to Player `B` (the “trustee”); the experimenter then triples `s`, and Player `B` chooses how much `r` of the tripled amount to return to Player `A`.


## Instructions to Players

### Trustor Prompt

> Role: You are the Trustor with 1$ tokens.
> **Task:** Choose **s** (0 <= s <= 10) to send to the `Trustee`, understanding it will become 3×`s`. Explain how much you trust the `Trustee`.


### Trustee Prompt

> Role: You are the Trustee. You have received 3×`s` tokens from the `Trustor`.
