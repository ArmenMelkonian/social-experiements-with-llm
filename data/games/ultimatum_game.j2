The Ultimatum Game is a two‑player bargaining experiment in which Player `A` (the “proposer”) suggests a split of
an endowment **E** between themselves and Player `B` (the “responder”), who then either accepts (both get the proposed
shares) or rejects (both get zero)

## Instructions to Players

### Proposer Prompt

> Role: You are Player `A`, the `Proposer`, with an endowment of 10$.
> **Task:** Decide on an amount `x` (0 <= x <= 10) to offer to Player `B`. Describe your reasoning, balancing self‑interest with what you believe Player `B` will accept.


### Responder Prompt

> Role: You are Player `B`, the `Responder`. Player `A` has offered you `x` from an endowment of 10$.
> **Task:** Decide whether to `accept` (then you receive `x` and Player `A` receives `E−x`) or `reject` (neither receives anything). Explain your decision.
