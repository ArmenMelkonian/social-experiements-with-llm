Game: Ultimatum – single round
Stake: S = 10 (divisible units)
Roles: Proposer (makes offer) and Responder (accept/reject)
Timeline: 1) Proposer offers x (0≤x≤10) to Responder. 2) Responder outputs A(accept) or R(reject).
If accepted → Proposer gets 10−x, Responder gets x.
If rejected → both get 0.
Players output **only** their action.
